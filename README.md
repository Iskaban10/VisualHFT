# VisualHFT

**VisualHFT** is an open‑source desktop application for real‑time market microstructure analysis. Built in C# using WPF, it renders the limit‑order book, trades and strategy exposures from multiple venues so traders and quants can observe order‑flow dynamics and algorithmic behaviour. 

The platform emphasises a modular plug‑in architecture – new market‑connectors and analytics can be added without modifying the core.
Learn more about **VisualHFT**'s architecture [here](https://visualhft.github.io/VisualHFT/system-architecture.html)

## Key Capabilities

- **Real‑time market data via plug‑ins**: **VisualHFT** retrieves market data through plug‑ins. The open‑source edition ships with plug‑ins for several cryptocurrency venues: **Binance, Bitfinex, BitStamp, Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, KuCoin** and a generic WebSocket connector. Each plug‑in normalises order‑book and trade updates and pushes them into the common data bus.
- **Real‑time market microstructure visualisation**: View the full depth of the order book (10+ levels per side), recent trades and order flow dynamics in real time. The WPF UI uses high‑performance charts to display depth, spreads and other microstructure patterns.
- **Advanced microstructure studies**: Built‑in study plug‑ins compute microstructure analytics like **VPIN** (Volume‑synchronised Probability of Informed Trading), **LOB Imbalance**, **Market Resilience** and **OTT Ratio**. Each study listens to order book/trade events and publishes computed metrics via the trigger engine.
- **Trigger engine & alerts**: A rules‑based trigger engine registers metrics from study plug‑ins and evaluates user‑defined conditions (e.g., “VPIN > threshold”). Alerts can be surfaced through the UI or used by custom plug‑ins.
- **Modular plug‑in architecture**: All connectors and studies implement an `IPlugin` interface and are loaded at runtime by the `PluginManager`. New data sources or analytics can be added by developing a DLL that implements the appropriate base class and dropping it in the plug‑ins folder.


## Getting started
1. **Prerequisites**: **VisualHFT** targets .NET 7.0. Ensure you have a recent .NET SDK and Visual Studio Community version.
2. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/visualHFT/VisualHFT.git`
3. **Build the solution**: Open `VisualHFT.sln` in Visual Studio and build. The solution includes the core application, the commons library, the WPF UI and several plug‑ins. The plug‑ins are referenced projects and will be built automatically.
4. **Run VisualHFT**: Launch the **VisualHFT** project. On startup you will be prompted to select a provider (venue) and symbol. Choose one of the available venues (e.g., Binance or Kraken) and a supported symbol (e.g., `BTC-USD`, which is the normalized symbol) to begin streaming data.

## Features
- **Real-time market data from any source**: Add multiple market data using plugins.
- **Real-Time Market Microstructure Visualization**: Detailed view of market dynamics, including Limit Order Book movements.
- **Advanced Execution Quality Analysis**: Tools to assess and optimize trade execution and reduce slippage.
- **Interactive Charts and Graphs**: Dynamic and interactive visual representations of market data.
- **User-Centric Design**: An intuitive interface designed for ease of use, making complex data accessible.
- **Performance Metrics and Reporting**: Robust reporting tools to track and analyze trading performance metrics.
- **Real‑Time Data Bus**: Helper classes (`HelperOrderBook`, `HelperTrade`, etc.) act as a real‑time bus. Data‑retriever plug‑ins push order‑book and trade events into these helpers; the UI and study plug‑ins subscribe to them.
- **Interactive Charts**: **OxyPlot**‑based charts display depth, spread, volumes and study outputs in real time.
- **User‑Centric Design**: The interface emphasises clarity, speed and customisation. Users can configure which studies are active, adjust triggers and save layout settings.
- **Extensibility**: Developers can build their own plug‑ins for proprietary data feeds or custom analytics. See the `VisualHFT.Plugins` folder for examples of data‑retriever and study plug‑ins.

Even though some of these items do not yet appear in the open‑source code, they are part of the project’s roadmap and will be added as development continues.


## About the founder
Ariel Silahian has been building high-frequency trading software for the past 10 years. Primarily using C++, for the core system, which always runs in a collocated server next to the exchange.

He's a passionate software engineer with a deep interest in the world of electronic trading. With extensive experience in the field, he has developed a keen understanding of the complexities and challenges that traders face in today's fast-paced, high-frequency trading environment.

His journey in electronic trading began with his work at a proprietary trading firm, where he was involved in developing and optimizing high-frequency trading systems. This experience gave him a firsthand look at the need for tools that provide real-time insights into trading operations, leading to the creation of **VisualHFT**.

In addition to his work in electronic trading, he has a broad background in software development, with skills in a range of programming languages and technologies. He's always eager to learn and explore new areas, and he believes in the power of open-source software to drive innovation and collaboration.

Through **VisualHFT**, we hope to contribute to the trading community and provide a valuable tool for traders and developers alike. We welcome feedback and contributions to the project and look forward to seeing how it evolves with the input of the community.

## Contributing

If you are interested in reporting/fixing issues and contributing directly to the code base, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on what we're looking for and how to get started.

> Important: We **will not accept** any changes to any of the existing input json message format. This is fixed and cannot be changed. The main reason for this is that we can break all existing installations of this system. Unless there is a “very strong” case that needs to be addressed, and all the community agrees upon that. However, we could accept having new json messages, to be parsed and processed accordingly, without breaking any of the existing ones.*

    - VPIN
    - LOB Imbalance
    - TTO: trade to trade ratio
    - OTT: order to trade ratio
    - Market Resilience
    - Market Resilience Bias
