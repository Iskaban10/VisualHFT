# 🤝 Partner Quant Program  
*Build like a founder. Own like a partner.*

---

## What is This?

The **Partner Quant Program** is VisualHFT’s equity-based contributor track — a way for deeply committed technical builders to earn long-term ownership in the platform.

This is not a bounty board.  
This is not a freelance gig.  
This is **early-stage technical co-creation** — in exchange for real equity.

We're assembling a small group of contributor-partners who will help us ship the core product, own modules, and shape VisualHFT into the go-to visibility layer for market microstructure analytics.

## What You Get

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Equity Ownership** | 0.25%–1.0% of VisualHFT, based on your contribution tier |
| **Contributor Recognition** | Attribution in docs, GitHub, and blog posts |
| **Long-Term Role** | Path to full-time salaried role when funding/traction allow |
| **Vesting** | 2-year vesting with a 3-month cliff and milestone gating |

> ⚠️ **No salary or compensation at this stage.**  
> This is an equity-only contributor role, structured for those who believe in the product and want skin in the game.

## Who Is This For?

We're looking for people who:
- Are passionate about market structure, trading systems, or real-time infra.
- Want to work async, independently, and own serious parts of a product.
- Think like founders — you care about the product *as a whole*, not just your code.
- Don’t need a fancy title to ship exceptional work.

Whether you’re a new graduate reverse-engineering our repo or an experienced quant dev tired of building black-box tools, we care about your **energy, not your résumé**.

---

## Example Contributions

We’re looking for real leverage. Things like:

- 🔍 **Quant Signal Modules:**  
  VPIN, LOB Imbalance, OTR/TOB ratios, latency surfaces

- 🔌 **Infra Plugins:**  
  Kafka, FIX, ITCH, PCAP — live or historical stream connectors

- 📈 **Visual Tools:**  
  Execution slippage heatmaps, spoofing alerts, quote stuffing tracebacks

- 🧠 **Market Insight Tools:**  
  Auto-tagging engines, anomaly clustering, post-trade diagnostics

If you’ve got a wild idea that fits the VisualHFT mission — pitch it.

## How It Works

1. **Apply via Form:**  
   Fill out [this application](https://denim-cephalopod-44a.notion.site/214948c26e60802996a7fe8734cd07ff?pvs=105) to tell us about your skills and motivation.

2. **Initial Scope:**  
   We’ll align on a module or project you want to lead.

3. **Contribute + Commit:**  
   You build with rigor and stay involved post-merge. This isn’t drive-by dev.

4. **Earn Equity:**  
   You’re formally onboarded with a Contributor Equity Agreement. Vesting begins after 3 months of consistent contribution.

## Open vs. Equity Contributions

Anyone can fork the repo, submit PRs, or suggest ideas.  
But equity is **reserved for those accepted into the Partner Quant Program** — the contributors we see as potential long-term builders and eventual employees.

---

## Legal & IP

You’ll sign a Contributor Equity Agreement and IP Assignment upon entry.  
All work must be original and production-grade. We’re building for the long term.

> You don’t need a title. Just passion, discipline, and a desire to ship the product you wish already existed.
